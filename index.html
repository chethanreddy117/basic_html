    <h2><i>Tony Stark</i> </h2>
     
    <p>Tony Stark. Genius, billionaire, philanthropist. Son of legendary inventor and weapons contractor Howard Stark.
    Tony Stark, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his late father Howard Stark, is in war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison, Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, to demonstrate the new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, his convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by a missile used by the attackersâ€”one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings. Yinsen, a fellow captive and doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but he and Yinsen believe that Raza will not keep his word.
    When Tony Stark is assigned to give a weapons presentation to an Iraqi unit led by Lt. Col. James Rhodes, he's given a ride on enemy lines. That ride ends badly when Stark's Humvee that he's riding in is attacked by enemy combatants. He survives - barely - with a chest full of shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart. In order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else. Thus Iron Man is born. He uses the primitive device to escape from the cave in Iraq. Once back home, he then begins work on perfecting the Iron Man suit. But the man who was put in charge of Stark Industries has plans of his own to take over Tony's technology for other matters.</p>

     <p align="justify">After being kidnapped by a powerful terrorist organization,All this and more sums up Tony Stark. After a weapons presentation in Iraq, Stark gets himself captured which also results in him having a chest filled with shrapnel. Needing to escape, he miniaturizes it and dons a suit of armor. This results in the birth of the Armored Avenger Iron Man. Once returned safely, Stark works to perfect his design and uses it to protect all mankind. This activity catches the eye of a mysterious organization known as SHIELD. On the other hand, the chairman of Stark Industries discovers this and has plans of his own for Tony's work. brilliant industrialist Tony Stark narrowly escapes using an iron suit he crafted from scrap metal and spare parts. Upon returning home, he devotes all of his time and resources to perfecting the iron man suit, and using it to fight evil, sometimes in the place where he least expects it.</p>
   
  <p align="justify">The terrorists, members of a group called the the Ten Rings, show off a huge stockpile of weapons -- all made by Stark Industries. Tony appears to give in and starts building the missile, but he has other plans. With Yinsen's steady doctor's hands, and using palladium collected from his weapons, Tony constructs a tiny version of an arc reactor, streamlined from a much bigger design used at his company's headquarters. The power output is enough to run Stark's heart for "fifty lifetimes... or something much bigger for about 15 minutes." It will also be enough to keep the shrapnel in Tony's heart from shifting any further and killing him. Yinsen tells Tony a little about himself; he lived in an Afghani village called Gulmira that was attacked by the Ten Rings. He doesn't know if his family is still alive. He also reveals that he'd met Tony years before at a conference but Tony was so drunk that night he probably doesn't remember him.</p>

  <h3>What is an arc reactor?</h3>
  <p>
   The Arc Reactor is also the power source of Stark Tower (later moved underground and the tower was renamed Avengers Tower) and a miniaturized arc reactor was created to power the Iron Man suit.
    The Arc Reactor was a fusion type power source featuring a palladium core, and was the initial power source of the first Iron Man suits, and was later modified to an advanced level by Tony Stark to power his more advanced suits, as it kept on improving. 
     
        The Arc Reactor was a fusion type power source featuring a palladium core, and was the initial power source of the first Iron Man suits, and was later modified to an advanced level by Tony Stark to power his more advanced suits, as it kept on improving. During the events of Iron Man 2, Tony re-discovered and synthesized a new element theorized by Howard Stark, as a clean and safe core alternative to palladium core. This not only stopped palladium poisoning of Tony's body but also reversed its effects, saving his life.
        The Stark Industries HQ in Los Angeles was once powered by an Arc Reactor, but it was destroyed when Pepper Potts overloaded it and Obadiah Stane with his Iron Monger Armor fell into the reactor. It is unknown what happened to the reactor after this event.

  <p align="left">However, Tony had other plans. While being held captive in a dank cave, he secretly crafted an ingenious suit of armor, equipped with an array of high-tech gadgets and weaponry. Determined to escape and put an end to the reign of terror, Tony became something more than a man; he became a symbol of hope and protection.
        With his newfound power, Tony managed to break free from his captors and returned to the United States. But he realized that his company's weapons were causing harm and destruction around the world. Driven by guilt and a desire to right his wrongs, Tony made a bold decision. He declared that Stark Industries would no longer produce weapons and instead focus on developing technology for the betterment of mankind.Tony is spurred and seems to have a change of heart. He begins to draw up plans for a weapon system, an armored suit powered by the arc reactor that he will wear and use to defeat the terrorists. Midway through construction, the head of the Ten Rings, Raza (Faran Tahir), arrives and threatens to torture Yinsen, angry because he thinks Stark is not working on the Jericho as they wanted. Tony bargains for Yinsen's life, saying he makes a good assistant. Raza gives them one more day to finish.
        Working furiously overnight, Tony completes his project. Yinsen straps Tony into the completed armored suit, telling him the way out of the cave. They set off a bomb inside the cell door as a distraction for the guards as Tony powers up his suit. Yinsen realizes that they will not have enough time. Over Tony's protests, he grabs a gun and runs off to distract the surviving guards.

<p>J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a fictional character voiced by Paul Bettany in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise, based on the Marvel Comics characters Edwin Jarvis and H.O.M.E.R., respectively the household butler of the Stark family and another AI designed by Stark. J.A.R.V.I.S. is an artificial intelligence created by Tony Stark, who later controls his Iron Man and Hulkbuster armor for him. In Avengers: Age of Ultron, after being partially destroyed by Ultron, J.A.R.V.I.S. is given physical form as Vision, physically portrayed by Bettany. Different versions of the character also appear in comics published by Marvel Comics, depicted as AI designed by Iron Man and Nadia van Dyne</p>

    Meanwhile, Tony continued to refine his armored suit, using his genius engineering skills to enhance its capabilities. The suit, now equipped with flight capabilities, an array of repulsor rays, and an artificial intelligence assistant named J.A.R.V.I.S., became Tony's alter ego â€” Iron Man.

As Iron Man, Tony embarked on a mission to dismantle Stark Industries' weapons stockpile and prevent his technology from falling into the wrong hands. He utilized his suit to confront terrorists, criminals, and anyone who posed a threat to innocent lives. With each victory, Iron Man's reputation grew, and the world began to see him as a hero.

However, Stane's betrayal reached its climax when he revealed his true intentions to Tony. He had been secretly developing his own suit of armor, heavily weaponized and fueled by greed and power. A fierce battle ensued between Iron Man and Stane, with their suits clashing in an explosive confrontation.

In the end, Tony's intellect, resourcefulness, and determination prevailed. He defeated Stane and saved the day, proving that a single man, armed with ingenuity and a strong moral compass, could make a difference. Tony had transformed from a self-absorbed billionaire into a true hero.

Tony Stark's journey as Iron Man had only just begun. This first chapter in his story not only marked the birth of a new superhero but also the redemption of a man who had once valued profit over the lives of others. Iron Man would go on to face even greater challenges and become a founding member of the Avengers, leaving an indelible mark on the world as a symbol of heroism, innovation, and sacrifice.
